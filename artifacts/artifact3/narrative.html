  <h1>Artifact 3 — Narrative</h1>
    <p>This project is a PGA Tour Stats Research UI that I built in August 2025. It connects to the DataGolf API to pull live round-level stats from PGA events and shows player averages like driving distance, strokes gained putting, approach, and total performance. I added this project to my ePortfolio to show that I can work with real-world APIs, process data, and build a working user interface that’s easy to use. The app also has placeholders for adding a backend and custom metric builder, showing that I planned for future improvements. While the API is not currently connected through a key, due to subscription and payment reasons, it is fully structured and ready to implement. 
I chose this project because it covers several key areas of software development: getting and cleaning raw data, averaging values for each player, and building a UI that allows users to search and view the results. It highlights my ability to write clean React code, manage state, and work with JSON from an external API. I met my course goals from Module One, which included showing I could build a data-focused app and apply what I learned in a real example.
While building this project, I learned how to group and average a large number of entries for each player, how to structure an intuitive UI that benefits data lookup, and how to keep the app fast even with a lot of data. One of the biggest challenges was transforming the raw round data into readable and accurate player stats. This helped me get better at handling and organizing data from APIs. Overall, this project was a strong way to show my skills in APIs, data processing, and frontend development.
