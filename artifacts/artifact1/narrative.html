      <p>ENHANCEMENT ONE: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE AND AGILE-SCRUM METHODOLOGIES

The original artifact for this project was a Sprint Review and Retrospective document created approximately six months ago during CS250: Software Development Lifecycle. It captured my team’s implementation of the Scrum-Agile framework while building a travel agency application. While the document demonstrated a solid understanding of Agile methodology, I wanted to expand the project for my capstone ePortfolio to more thoroughly reflect my skills in business analysis, project management, stakeholder communication, and software development practices.
	To enhance the artifact, I created and included several professional grade documents: a detailed Agile Team Charter, comprehensive user stories with acceptance criteria, and a structured test case matrix. These documents showcase my ability to gather requirements, define and manage stakeholders, organize development tasks using Agile best practices, and validate outcomes through well planned testing. Each enhancement provides a clearer picture of my capacity to lead and collaborate within the SDLC while fulfilling multiple roles, including Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Analyst.
	I selected this project for my ePortfolio because it best aligns with my career goals in business analysis, software implementation, and project management. By updating and expanding the deliverables, I ensured that the work reflects the skills employers value: clear documentation, iterative development planning, and structured team coordination. The enhancements also allowed me to adjust the presentation of my work to better match the course outcomes I aimed to meet in module one, particularly those focused on Agile planning, communication, and system validation.
	This enhancement process deepened my appreciation for stakeholder alignment, early documentation, and test driven planning. One of the main challenges I faced was organizing the user stories in a way that balanced real world relevance with clarity for developers and testers. However, the process helped solidify my understanding of how effective requirement gathering and testing strategies play a foundational role in project success. Ultimately, these enhancements transformed a basic classroom assignment into a robust demonstration of my applied knowledge in software development and Agile project management.
