  <p>Sprint Review and Retrospective

Hunter R. Lucas
CS250 Software Development Lifecycle
Professor Nicholas Schnack
December 15, 2024







Adopting a Scrum-Agile framework for software development significantly influenced the way our team operated and delivered value for 
the SNHU Travel project. Traditionally, ChadaTech had relied on a waterfall methodology, which meant requirements were fixed early on, 
and development followed a rigid, sequential path. By shifting to Scrum-Agile, we embraced an iterative and flexible process that allowed
for continuous feedback, adaptation, and rapid delivery of features.
One of the cornerstones of Scrum is the clarity and focus provided by well-defined roles. Our Product Owner played a critical part by 
providing a clear and concise vision for the final product. In this project, the PO outlined the need to enhance the SNHU Travel website 
by focusing on a slideshow-style listing of travel options instead of a basic list view. From the outset, the PO made it clear what 
success would look like, which gave the development team a targeted goal and avoided unnecessary guesswork. I ensured that the team 
remained on schedule, facilitated daily stand-ups, removed roadblocks, and served as an intermediary between the Product Owner and the 
development team. This kept everyone aligned and ensured our focus never wavered from the sprint goals.
The development team took the clearly defined requirements and transformed them into working software. By having the Product Owner’s 
vision upfront and receiving constant guidance from myself, we efficiently built out the slideshow product and the pivot to a content 
focus on health/detox within the established timeline. This synergy between roles was evident when we rapidly pivoted from a list-based 
format to a slideshow design without missing our deadline. Each role contributed directly to maintaining a cohesive workflow, enabling 
quick decision-making and consistent forward progress.
Within the Scrum framework, user stories form the backbone of development tasks. Instead of relying on lengthy requirement documents, 
the user stories provided concise, user-focused insights that guided what we needed to build. We heard directly from users about their 
needs such as setting a budget for searches and allowing the app to know what kind of vacations the users were looking for. They then 
translated these insights into actionable tasks. For example, when a user story described a desire to view curated travel options in a 
dynamic slideshow format, we knew exactly what problem we were solving.
The Scrum-Agile approach ensured that we could prioritize these stories in our backlog, estimate their complexity, and break them down 
into manageable increments. Because of this, we were continuously delivering functional features and receiving feedback. This iterative 
approach allowed us to confirm that the user stories were accurately addressed before moving on to the next set of priorities. Rather 
than waiting until the end of a long development cycle to validate our work, we could confirm early on that we were on the right track.
The Scrum-Agile methodology thrives on adaptability. Midway through development, we were informed that the SNHU Travel application needed 
to shift from a basic list view to a slideshow format. Under a waterfall model, such a fundamental change might have required significant 
rework or even a complete restart. Instead, because we had been working in small increments and continuously testing our code, we could 
adapt quickly.
We leveraged the iterative nature of Scrum by revisiting our sprint backlog, re-prioritizing tasks, and adjusting our sprint goals. Since 
the team had already built modular, testable code, shifting directions did not mean discarding all our work. We integrated the new 
slideshow components, tested them during the sprint, and ensured the final product still met the deadline. This agility demonstrates one 
of the key strengths of Scrum.
Effective communication was our success. Regular meetings kept everyone informed, while sprint planning and review sessions aligned the 
entire team on priorities and deliverables. In addition to these events, clear and concise communication played a pivotal role in 
ensuring transparency. For example, I sent an email to both the Product Owner and the Tester to clarify the new focus on detox and health 
vacations:
Dear Product Owner and Tester,
As we shift focus to prioritize detox and health vacations for the SNHU Travel site, I need your guidance to align development with this 
new direction.
For the Product Owner, please provide updated requirements, insights into the target audience, and any new content to incorporate.
For the Tester, I need updated testing scenarios relevant to the new focus and detailed feedback on functionality and user experience as 
features are developed.
All the best,
Hunter
We utilized spreadsheets and other simple organizational tools to track user stories, their acceptance criteria, and their associated 
development tasks. These tools were reviewed during Scrum events, such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews to ensure 
everyone had a shared understanding of the project’s status. This visibility into priorities and progress supported the iterative nature 
of Scrum, ensuring that every sprint delivered tangible value and that the team remained focused on the highest-priority items.
The Scrum-Agile approach offered significant advantages for this specific project. By building incrementally and delivering small chunks 
of functionality, we were able to confirm early that we were meeting user needs. When the project requirements changed, Scrum allowed us 
to pivot quickly and integrate the slideshow format without sacrificing overall deadlines. The daily checkpoints and continuous 
collaboration mitigated communication gaps and kept quality high.
There were, however, some drawbacks. Rapid changes sometimes meant re-estimating tasks on the fly, causing short-term confusion. 
Additionally, those unaccustomed to Scrum needed time to adapt to the faster feedback cycles and the need for constant collaboration. 
Despite these minor challenges, the benefits far outweighed the drawbacks.
For the SNHU Travel project, Scrum-Agile was unquestionably the best approach. The method’s inherent flexibility, emphasis on 
collaboration, and iterative delivery model allowed the team to respond swiftly to changing requirements while maintaining a clear focus 
on user needs. This proved invaluable when external factors necessitated a shift in our product vision.
Reflecting on the Sprint Review and Retrospective of the SNHU Travel project, it is evident that the Scrum-Agile framework played a 
pivotal role in our success. By clearly defining roles, relying on user stories, maintaining open communication, utilizing effective 
organizational tools, and embracing change rather than resisting it, we delivered a product that met evolving user and business 
requirements on schedule. This experience has demonstrated to me that Scrum-Agile is not only a viable methodology but, in fact, an 
advantageous approach for all development.
