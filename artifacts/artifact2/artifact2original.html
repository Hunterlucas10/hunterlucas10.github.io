  <p>To solve the treasure maze game, I used a deep Q learning algorithm to train my intelligent agent, a pirate, to find a treasure hidden in the maze. This project helped me understand how machines approach problems differently from humans. A human would look at the maze, figure out possible paths, and use memory and reasoning to avoid dead ends and move closer to the goal. A person might also learn from past tries and avoid making the same mistakes. On the other hand, a machine like my pirate agent does not see or think like a person. Instead, it uses numbers, calculations, and trial and error to learn the best moves over time. If a person was placed in this maze, they would probably try to move in a direction that looks open and continue adjusting their steps based on what they observe. Humans might try to backtrack if they run into walls or dead ends. They might also look for patterns or use logic to guess which directions are more likely to lead to the treasure. A human uses vision, memory, and problem solving strategies that come naturally with experience. My intelligent agent, however, learns by interacting with the maze many times. It starts by exploring different directions randomly. After each move, it receives a reward depending on whether it moved closer to the treasure, hit a wall, revisited a cell, or found the treasure. The agent remembers these experiences and uses them to update a neural network model that predicts which moves will likely result in higher rewards. (Botvinick et al., 2019) Over time, the model gets better at picking actions that help the pirate find the treasure faster. This is reinforcement learning, where the agent learns what actions to take in order to maximize the reward. The main similarity between a human and the intelligent agent is that both learn from experience. They both adjust their strategy over time to get better at solving the maze. But the difference is in how they learn. Humans use logic and thinking, while the agent uses math, data, and lots of practice.
The purpose of my intelligent agent in this game is to find the shortest or most successful path to the treasure using only trial and error and memory from past moves. It doesn’t know where the treasure is at first. It just keeps learning from each game until it builds a strong understanding of what works and what doesn’t. This helps the agent become more reliable and efficient. In reinforcement learning, there is something called exploration and exploitation. Exploration means trying out new actions, even if they might not give the best results right away. Exploitation means using what the agent already knows to pick the best move. The balance between these two is important. If the agent explores too much, it might waste time trying bad moves. If it only exploits what it already knows, it might miss a better path (Yoon, 2018). For this game, a good balance starts with high exploration and slowly lowers it as the agent gets smarter. Reinforcement learning helps the pirate figure out the path by rewarding smart decisions and punishing poor ones. The pirate learns to avoid mistakes like running into walls or going in circles. The model slowly shapes its actions based on how successful they are, and eventually, it learns the best route to the treasure from any starting point. To build this, I used deep Q learning with a neural network. The network has layers that take the current maze state and predict which action will lead to the best result. I stored experiences of each move and trained the model using batches of those experiences. This way, the model didn’t just learn from the latest move but from a variety of past games. Over time, the agent’s win rate reached 100%, showing that it had learned the best way to solve the maze. This project showed me how powerful machine learning is when it comes to solving problems that seem simple for humans but require smart algorithms for computers.
